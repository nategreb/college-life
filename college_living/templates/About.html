                    As a recent graduate, I am committed to making a positive impact on other university students. My
                    goal is for
                    people to use this site for all their college-related needs. Whether that be
                    being informed about specific courses, or even connecting with students in their courses. Hopefully,
                    this will make your college experience that much better.
